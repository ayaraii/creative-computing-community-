I will be exploring how creative computing benefits our society and helps us learn more about the world around us 

**Introduction** 

Computing has been a very helpful when supporting human creativity. Computational thinking has had a great economic and societal impact and has facilitated research, education and design. It has helped us develop a more profound thought process in order to find solutions to our problems and explore useful knowledge outside the traditional area.

**Learning about creative computing**

I began by learning more about creative computing and physical computing (arduino and open source) as well as testing my skills.

**THE IDEA**

My idea is to use creative computing to have easier access to new and information about the world surrounding me. I am lebanese and so I decided to give the example of the situation in Lebanon right now and how the explosion of August 4th 2020 and many other factors lead to where we are today.

My goal was to help raise awarness, knowledge discovery and introducing computing to make our lives easier.
