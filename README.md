# How-creative-computing-benefits-our-society
I will be exploring how creative computing benefits our society and helps us learn more about the world around us 

**Introduction** 

Computing has been a very helpful when supporting human creativity. Computational thinking has had a great economic and societal impact and has facilitated research, education and design. It has helped us develop a more profound thought process in order to find solutions to our problems and explore useful knowledge outside the traditional area.

**Learning about creative computing**

I began by learning more about creative computing and physical computing (arduino and open source) as well as testing my skills.

**THE IDEA**

My idea is to use creative computing to have easier access to new and information about the world surrounding me. I am lebanese and so I decided to give the example of the situation in Lebanon right now and how the explosion of August 4th 2020 and many other factors lead to where we are today. 
I started with researching information about the issues in Lebanon and how i can represent them using creative computing 

These are some references i used for updated news about Lebanon

**FIRST DRAFT**

My first idea was to create a series of numbers that would form the lebanase flag. Some of the numbers would be a link that would give you access to news about lebanon. Each number/series of numbers is equivalent to a number of victims, cases, percentages that relate to the crisis in lebanon. For example, the number 55 is the poverty rate in Lebanon today. I chose to use numbers because if a person sees a number they would be curious to find out what it means how it relates to Lebanon. Its a more interesting and creative way of presenting the news.  

After testing and creating different prototypes, I decided to use the word "LEBANON" instead of the flag. I then placed the numbers and their meaning.

FINAL PROPOSAL

My goal creating this proposal is to help raise awarness, encourage knowledge discovery and introduce computing to make our lives easier. 
I believe creative computing is going to keep people curious and will develop in a way that's even more interactive and interesting.
