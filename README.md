# A-tragedy-in-the-making-
I will be exploring how creative computing benefits our society and helps us learn more about the world around us 

**Introduction** 

Computing has been a very helpful when supporting human creativity. Computational thinking has had a great economic and societal impact and has facilitated research, education and design. It has helped us develop a more profound thought process in order to find solutions to our problems and explore useful knowledge outside the traditional area.

**Learning about creative computing**

I started off with researching what creative computing is and I learned about physical computing (arduino and open source)

**THE IDEA**

My idea is to use creative computing to have easier access to new and information about the world surrounding me. I am lebanese and so I decided to give the example of the situation in Lebanon right now and how the explosion of August 4th 2020 and many other factors lead to where we are today.
